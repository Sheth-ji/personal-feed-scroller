## Philosophy

This project embraces the spirit of old-school internet software:
- Does one thing well
- Respects your privacy
- No dark patterns or manipulation
- Free and open source
- No monetization of your attention

## Privacy & Security

**Your data never leaves your device.**

- ✅ No uploads to any server
- ✅ No tracking or analytics
- ✅ No internet connection required
- ✅ Files are read directly from your local storage
- ✅ Everything runs in your browser

You can verify this by turning off your internet connection - the app works exactly the same.

## Security

**Is my data safe?**

Yes. Here's how:

🔒 **Browser Isolation** - Your photos are isolated from other websites by your browser's built-in security (Same-Origin Policy)

🔒 **No Network Access** - The app doesn't connect to the internet at all. Even if someone compromised another website you're visiting, they cannot access your photos through this app.

🔒 **HTTPS Delivery** - When hosted on GitHub Pages, the app is served over HTTPS, preventing tampering during download

🔒 **Open Source** - All code is visible. You (or anyone technical) can inspect it to verify there's no malicious behavior

🔒 **No Persistence** - When you close the tab, all loaded data is cleared from memory

**The only real risk:** Malicious browser extensions that have access to all your tabs. This is outside any web app's control - choose your browser extensions wisely!

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers. For best experience:
- **Desktop**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **Mobile**: Chrome (Android), Safari (iOS)
